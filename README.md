## Features:
* Easy Git Repository Creation
	* Git repositories for projects can be created with a minimal amount of clicks.

* Backup Projects in Bulk
	* Projects can be archived with one click and saved to a specific directory.

* Save Time Through Templates & Keywords
	* Text files that need to exist for each project (readme, changelog, license, etc.) can be auto-generated through templates.
	* Templates are customizable with keywords and are made to be completely extensible.
	* New templates can be created, and new keywords defined.

* Project Customization via Modules
	* Modules allow SCG to support projects of specific types, such as Divinity: Original Sin 2 mods.

* Markdown Converter
	* SCG contains a built-in Markdown converter, for converting markdown to various formats, such as BBcode and HTML.
	
*Note that the "Divinity Original Sin 2" module is the only one currently available, as SCG was initially created with that game in mind.*
